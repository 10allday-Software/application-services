## Metrics collected by Application Services components

Some application-services components collect telemetry using the [Glean SDK](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/).
This directory contains auto-generated documentation for all such metrics.

Products that send telemetry via Glean and use the below components *must request* a data-review following
[the Firefox Data Collection process](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection).
